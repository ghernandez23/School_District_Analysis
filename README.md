# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
Due to the newly obtained information stating that grades in both math and reading have been altered for students in 9th grade at Thomas High School I have been tasked with removing their grades from the schools overall averages as well as redoing the overall school district analysis without their grades included. 

## Results
After removing Thomas High Schools entire 9th grade math and reading scores from the overall analysis of the High School, the data remains very similar. Thomas High School initially had a 90.94 passing percentage for both math and reading, now their average is at 90.63 percent. With such a small change in the overall average, this did not effect Thomas High Schools placement within the district of top performing schools. 

## Summary
Based on the new analysis of Thomas High School, there were very little changes in the data after removing the 9th grades information. There was a slight change in the schools passing percentage in math and reading, but still within the 90th percentile overall. This new information did not change the school districts average by much either.
